Kerala Healthcare Resource Optimization Project

1. Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to optimize healthcare resource allocation across Kerala districts using machine learning and linear programming techniques.

2. Data Collection
Data was collected from official Government of Kerala healthcare infrastructure reports (2023–24). District-level data for beds, ICU units, ventilators, ambulances, doctors, nurses, IP and OP demand were extracted from PDF reports and converted into structured CSV format.

3. Data Cleaning
Missing values were handled, district names standardized, and datasets merged into a single processed dataset named kerala_healthcare_infrastructure_2023_24.csv.

4. Feature Engineering
The following indices were created:
- Bed Stress Index
- ICU Stress Index
- Ventilator Stress Index
- Doctor Load
- Nurse Load
- Ambulance Risk Index
- Demand Risk Index (Composite metric)

5. Exploratory Analysis
District-level comparisons and heatmaps were generated to identify high-risk regions.

6. Machine Learning Models
The following models were trained and evaluated:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Extra Trees
- Random Forest

Evaluation Metrics:
- MAE
- RMSE
- R² Score

7. Model Selection
Ridge Regression was selected as the best performing model due to lowest RMSE and highest R² score, along with stable generalization.

8. Stress Testing
Demand surge scenarios from 1.0x to 2.0x were simulated. System failure increases significantly beyond 1.6x surge multiplier.

9. Optimization
Linear Programming was used to minimize unmet demand under healthcare resource constraints.

10. Conclusion
The project demonstrates that structured predictive modeling combined with optimization techniques can significantly improve healthcare resource planning and emergency preparedness at district level.
